# Iskolink

IskoLink is an online platform for the Association of DOST Scholars - Holy Angel University Student Chapter (ADS-HAUSC), built to strengthen connections among scholars and create a lasting impact on the community. More than just a hub for updates and resources, this website promotes education, outreach, and collaboration, allowing scholars to use science and technology for meaningful change. Through knowledge-sharing and service, IskoLink empowers scholars to inspire future leaders and contribute to national development.

## Background
The Association of DOST Scholars - Holy Angel University Student Chapter or ADS-HAUSC is one of the accredited scholar organizations of the DOST-SEI. It is a community of scholars dedicated to learning, innovation, and service. It was founded in July 2023 in efforts to unite a community of DOST scholars studying at Holy Angel University. It brings scholars together to promote science, technology, and environmental awareness while upholding values of adaptability, integrity, and excellence. Through collaboration and outreach, the organization aims to create positive change and inspire future leaders in science and technology.

In order to support its mission, creating a website as a project with the title “IskoLink” would be beneficial. IskoLink aims to serve as a website that would help the Association of DOST Scholars - HAU to have a digital platform that can help them connect, share information, and reach more people. This will enhance their communication and accessibility for the community, which will serve as a bridge between scholars, aspiring students, and the wider community. This will also make important resources, updates, and opportunities more readily available.

## Web Framework
IskoLink is built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js) to ensure a dynamic, scalable, and efficient web application. The frontend is designed with Angular, providing a responsive and interactive user experience, while the backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, handles data processing and API communication. MongoDB serves as the database, offering flexible and efficient data storage.

For styling, we utilize Tailwind CSS, ensuring a clean, modern, and responsive design. The combination of these technologies allows IskoLink to be highly maintainable, fast, and adaptable to future enhancements.
