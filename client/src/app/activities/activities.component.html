              The National Patriot Scholars Congress (NPSC) 2024 brought
              together DOST scholars from across the country to foster
              collaboration and leadership in nation-building. Held at The
              Manor, Camp John Hay, Baguio City, from September 3 to 6, this
              prestigious event served as a platform for over 500 scholars to
              deepen their commitment to serving the Filipino people.

              Representatives from ADS-HAUSC, Jan Michael Policarpio and Camille
              Janh Nolasco, proudly took part in discussions, networking
              opportunities, and interactive sessions designed to shape the next
              generation of leaders. Key figures, including DOST Secretary
              Renato U. Solidum Jr. and former DOST-SEI Secretary Dr. Josette
              Biyo, provided invaluable insights on leadership and public
