                    Does ADS-HAUSC provide financial assistance?
                </p>
                <p>
                    No. ADS-HAUSC is a student organization and DOES NOT provide financial assistance.
                    The DOST-SEI is the official provider of the scholarship. However, we support scholars
                    by fostering a strong academic community, offering mentorship, and sharing valuable resources
                    about scholarship opportunities. Through our outreach programs and initiatives, we also
                    strive to give back to the community, promoting education and helping future scholars access
                    the support they need.
